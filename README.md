# Three-Dimensional-Hands-Detection-Game-Utilized-With-Live-Camera

Develop a three-dimensional hands detection game that utilizes the live camera feed to detect the posture of the hands, ensuring that the hand positions observed in the game correspond to the real-time hand gestures. The game incorporates an animation wherein the hand simulates pressing the "Space" button, triggering a fire animation that emanates from the hand and propels objects in the forward direction. Additionally, the code incorporates voice recognition functionality, enabling the system to detect the spoken command "Fire" through the microphone, thereby initiating the fire animation from the hands using Unity 3D.
